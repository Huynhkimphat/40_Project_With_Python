# Project 14

## Spin a Yarn

#### Description

* Things get more interesting here since strings are infinitely more complex to play with at the beginning.

* The program first prompts the user to enter a series of inputs. These can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc.

* Once all the inputs are in place, they are placed in a premade story template using concatenation. In the end, the full story is printed out to read some misintended madness!
