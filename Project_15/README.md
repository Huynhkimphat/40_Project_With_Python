# Project 15

## Whatâ€™s the word?

### </br>

#### Description

* This name focuses on the user having to guess the randomly generated word. 

* You can create a list from which the word would have to be guessed and also set a cap on the number of guesses allowed.

* After this, you can create the rules yourself! When the user inputs the word, you can indicate whether the alphabet written appears in this particular position or not.

* You will need a function to check if the user is inputting alphabets or numbers and to display error messages appropriately.
