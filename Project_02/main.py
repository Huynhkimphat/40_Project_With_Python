The story of {0} tells of a kindhearted young woman who was treated cruelly by her stepmother and sisters, 
but, never the less, kept a humble attitude.

One day, The king's name is {1} and he decided to throw a ball and invited all the young maidens in the kingdom.
While {0}'s sisters made her help them get ready for the ball, not once did they ask her if she would like to go with them.

Once they left, her Fairy Godmother appeared and helped {0} go to the ball with a bit of magic that would only last until midnight.
At the ball, {0} caught the eye of the prince, as she was the most beautiful girl there, and they danced all night.

When midnight came, {0} had to leave the ball, and in her hurry, one of her glass slippers fell off her feet.
The prince found this slipper and vowed to marry the girl who the slipper belonged to.

The prince went from house to house, looking for the girl who’s foot fit the slipper, and he reached {0}'s house.
Though {0}'s stepsisters and stepmother tried to keep her from trying it on, the glass slipper was a perfect fit,
and she was soon married to the prince and lived happily ever after.

This is a wonderful story that captures how keeping a humble attitude will reap its rewards.

story_2 = """
Originating in France, this is the story of {0}, a beautiful peasant girl who took the place of her father, 
when he was taken prisoner by a fierce beast.

While things were uncomfortable and frightening for {0} at first, she soon grew fond of the beast, 
as he had done nothing but treat her with kindness. When {0} found out her father was sick, 
she begged the beast to let her go to him and promised to return, but she was held up by the evil Gaston, 
a famous hunter from the village who wanted to marry {0}. When the village found out about the beast, 
they vowed to kill him and stormed his castle. 

Though he nearly died, he was saved and turned into a handsome prince because of {0}’s love for him. 
It turns out that he had been a prince who, along with his entire household, 
was cursed by a witch because he did not treat her with kindness.
 {0} and the Prince marry, and live a happy and peaceful life together.

From the prince’s curse, children can learn about the importance of being kind and that if they do not, 
they will suffer bad consequences. From {0}, we learn to value what is in a person’s heart, 
rather than their outward appearance.
